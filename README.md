NetBotsStarterKit
=============

A Starter Kit For Netbots

This Solution has everything you need to get started buliding your very own Netbot. See the main project [here](https://github.com/Pabreetzio/BotWars) for full details.

These two bots are at http://rooturl.com/berserkerbot and http://rooturl.com/randombot. Any bots you create will be available at http://rooturl.com/yourBotClassName automatically so long as it implements the IRobot interface.

NetBotsStarterKit code is licensed under the MIT license. Code from the referenced Botwars project found in the /core folder is licensed separately by that project.
