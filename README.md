NetBotsClient
=============

A Starter Kit For Netbots

This Solution has everything you need to get started buliding your very own Netbot. See the main project [here](https://github.com/Pabreetzio/BotWars) for full details.

A really dumb sample bot ("Berserker Bot!") is included.  

If you plan to create your Netbot via a DLL, you can safely remove the NetBots.Host project from the solution.
